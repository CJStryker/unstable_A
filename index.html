<h2>AI in cybersec</h2>
  <p>AI is revolutionizing the field of cybersecurity by enhancing the capabilities of antivirus software. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, these solutions can detect and respond to threats more effectively than traditional methods. This proactive approach helps protect systems from a wide range of cyber threats in real-time.</p>
<p style="display:inline-block">AI enhances antivirus software in several ways:

    Behavioral Analysis: AI detects suspicious application behavior, identifying threats beyond known virus signatures.

    Machine Learning: Trained on large datasets, AI recognizes patterns in malware, allowing for the identification of new threats.

    Real-time Detection: AI monitors systems in real-time, enabling quick responses to emerging threats.

    Phishing Detection: AI analyzes emails and websites to identify potential phishing attempts.

    Automated Response: Some AI solutions can automatically quarantine or remove threats, reducing user intervention.

    Predictive Capabilities: AI predicts vulnerabilities based on historical data, helping organizations address security gaps proactively.
